## How large ##

This is just a normal text, and **This is a bold test**, __This is also bold__ 

*Here's the italic text*, _here is also italic_. _You **can** combine them_

You can even have links: [Google!](http://www.google.com)

Numbered lists:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Bullet Points:
* Line 1
* Line 2

Dash also works:
- For example:
  - subdash
  - 2 spaces infront

Can we have images?:




# This is a <h1> tags
## <h2> tags
##### <h5> tag

Blockquotes:<br>
As I said,
> We all will die
>> - Just YOLO


Tables:
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |


Inline code:
This is a inline code `var example = true`
How about ''This?''

This is a whole block code:
```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

This is a whole block code with language specified:

```python
for i in range(10):
  print("hello world")
```

$$ A_{1} = B_{2}^{n} $$

or can I do in line math? \\( sin(x^2) \\)

Task list:

1. [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported

Strikethrough
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out
I give this plugin two :tada: !
