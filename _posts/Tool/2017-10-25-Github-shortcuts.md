## How large ##

This is just a normal text, and **This is a bold test**, __This is also bold__ and *Here's the italic text*, _here is also italic_. _You **can** combine them_

You can even have links: [Google!](http://www.google.com)

Numbered lists:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Bullet Points:
* Line 1
* Line 2

Dash also works:
- For example:
  - subdash
  - 2 spaces infront

Can we have images?:
![Image of github]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/tools/github.png)

# This is a <h1> tags
## <h2> tags
##### <h5> tag

Blockquotes:
As I said,
> We all will die
> - Just YOLO

Inline code:
This is a inline code `var example = true`
This is a whole block code:
```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

This is a whole block code with language specified:
```python
if i in range(10):
  print("hello world")
```

Task list:

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

Tables:
|First Header | Second Header|
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
|Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2|
|Content in the first column | Content in the second column|

Strikethrough
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out

Github also supports emoji! :smile
