This is just a normal text, and **This is a bold test**, __This is also bold__ and *Here's the italic text*, _here is also italic_. _You **can** combine them_

You can even have links: [Google!](http://www.google.com)

Numbered lists:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Bullet Points:
* Line 1
* Line 2

Dash also works:
- For example:

  - 2 spaces infront
